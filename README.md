This Fitness App accurately calculates BMR with only two values of input.

BMR is the amount of calories/energy your body would consume if 
you were to do ZERO exercise and just go about your normal day.

You can then add in the cost of exercise to determine exactly 
how much weight you gained or lost on a particular day.
